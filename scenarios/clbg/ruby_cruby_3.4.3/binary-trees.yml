    The work is to fully create perfect binary trees - before any tree nodes are GC'd - using at-minimum the number of allocations of Jeremy Zerfas's C program. Don't optimize away the work.
    Leaf nodes must be the same as interior nodes - the same memory allocation. Don't optimize away the work.
    We ask that contributed programs not only give the correct result, but also use the same algorithm to calculate that result.
    Each program should:
        - define a tree node class and methods, or a tree node record and procedures, or an algebraic data type and functions, orâ€¦
        - allocate a binary tree to 'stretch' memory, check it exists, and deallocate it
        - allocate a long-lived binary tree which will live-on while other trees are allocated and deallocated
        - allocate, walk, and deallocate many bottom-up binary trees
            - allocate a tree
            - walk the tree, counting the nodes (and maybe deallocate the nodes)
            - deallocate the tree
        - check that the long-lived binary tree still exists
